## Data cleaning

* Standardize Columns: change to lower case and use _ between words instead of .
* Clean out NA values: 288 NA out of 53940 rows
* Standardize the values for the categorical variables: ex promotion had values of "Yes", "No", "No ", and ""
* Dropped rows where values were missing: out of 53,000 rows, the ones missing data was insignificant and therefore removed from analysis
